# Escape From Eschaton

    This script doesnt require any external python libraries. It is compliant with both python3.X and python2.X

# How to run

    A `v3_chart.json` should exist in the same folder as the script to run. The user can also enter the full path of other json files as well.

        $ python3 escape_eshaton.py
        $ python3 escape_eshaton.py /my/own/chart.json
