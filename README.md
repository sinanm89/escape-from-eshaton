# Escape From Eschaton

    This script doesnt require any external python libraries. It is
    compliant with both python3.X and python2.X

# How to run

    A `v3_chart.json` should exist in the same folder as the script to
    run. The user can also enter the full path of other json files as
    well.

    ```bash
        $ python3 escape_eshaton.py
        $ python3 escape_eshaton.py /my/own/chart.json
    ```
